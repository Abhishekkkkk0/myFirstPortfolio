          <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>It's been almost 2 months that I have completed my HTML, CSS which are one of the main languages I have been gone through. And in this portfolio I have applied only HTML, CSS for making it working and responsive. </p>

          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>In Git Hub I have learned how to create reposatary and pull the codes to the GIT HUB account. And this platform allows developers to work on projects together and share ideas from around the world. GitHub has built a reputation for having the largest and most-advanced development platform in the world.</p>

          <h2>Webflow and Setup</h2>
          <p>Webflow is a website design tool to help people build websites without having to worry about coding. With a drag-and-drop interface, the user builds the site they want in the editor, and when it's finished Webflow automatically generates the appropriate HTML, CSS or JavaScript.</p>
